ID	NUMBER	ENGLISH	NOTE	CONCEPTICON_ID	CONCEPTICON_GLOSS
Beaufils-2015-18-1	1	Eye	Stable word, with little exposure to semantic shift.	1248	EYE
Beaufils-2015-18-2	2	Ear	Pretty stable, semantically and also against erosion. Little probability to get borrowed from another language!	1247	EAR
Beaufils-2015-18-3	3	Nose	Very stable word, with little exposure to semantic shift and moderate daily use. Probably the best suited word for comparative linguistics!	1221	NOSE
Beaufils-2015-18-4	4	Hand	As many other parts of the body, little exposure to borrowing and good semantic stability. However, in many languages, the meaning shift from "hand" to "arm" or the other way round.	1277	HAND
Beaufils-2015-18-5	5	Tongue	Very stable - similar to nose, although it is also being used for "language" in many languages and gives it an exposure to semantic shift or at least to confusion.	1205	TONGUE
Beaufils-2015-18-6	6	Tooth	Very stable - similar conditions as "nose". However, this word has been subject to semantic shift in parts of the Indo-European family - with a mix "Tooth"/"Tongue" ("-Z-B-" in Slavic/Indo-Iranan languages).	1380	TOOTH
Beaufils-2015-18-7	7	Death	As an abstract concept, the use of this word for comparing remote languages is somewhat hazardous. However, it is the one best linking the Indo-Europea and Semitic language families (Arabic الموت (mut)/ Hebrew מוות (mavet) -> French "Mort" / Slavic "Mertv"... In some languages, the root of the verb "to die" has been taken instead of the substantive "death" when it was not available ("to die" is an element of the Swadesh list "death" is not)	910	DEATH
Beaufils-2015-18-8	8	Water	Very interesting word, although it is in intensive use and as such subject to more erosion. Moreover, semantic shift exposure is higher than for body parts. Water is the word best linking the Indo-European and Finno-Ugric language families (Finnish "Vesi" / Hungarian "Vez" -> German "Wasser" / Slavic "Voda")	948	WATER
Beaufils-2015-18-9	9	Sun	This word has a big exposure to semantic shift but delivers good results in comparative linguistics. Probably less suited for remote language relationships	1343	SUN
Beaufils-2015-18-10	10	Wind	As all nature related words, should have existed in early languages.	960	WIND
Beaufils-2015-18-11	11	Night	Very classical example in Indo-European studies...	1233	NIGHT
Beaufils-2015-18-12	12	Two	Little exposure to semantic shift but intensive use in daily life ("erosion")	1498	TWO
Beaufils-2015-18-13	13	Three	Little exposure to semantic shift but intensive use in daily life ("erosion"). Sometimes exposure to borrowing like in Kabylian (see Kabylian to Arabic comparison)	492	THREE
Beaufils-2015-18-14	14	Four	Little exposure to semantic shift but intensive use in daily life ("erosion"). Exposure to borrowing similar to "three".	1500	FOUR
Beaufils-2015-18-15	15	I	Very high exposure to erosion (intensive use in daily life) but little chance of semantic shift. Another problem with "I" is that it is monosyllabic in many languages - and monosyllabic resemblances between two languages are statistically more exposed to chance resemblance.	1209	I
Beaufils-2015-18-16	16	You	Very high exposure to erosion (intensive use in daily life) but little chance of semantic shift	1213	YOU
Beaufils-2015-18-17	17	Who	May be the least suited word in the study (erosion, semantic shift)	1235	WHO
Beaufils-2015-18-18	18	Name	This word links many languages to each other - although it should be used with caution as it is not sure it is common to proto-languages older than several thousands of years. Moreover, it may have been subject to borrowing in very remote times so that, after erosion, this borrowing isn't recognizable. Semantic shift between "name", "surname", "nickname"...	1405	NAME
