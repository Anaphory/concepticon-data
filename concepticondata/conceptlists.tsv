Swadesh-1971-100	Swadesh, Morris	1971		100	English	Global		Swadesh1971	This is a post-humously published 100-item list by Morris Swadesh. Basically, it is identical with the one published in [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the labels in this list are simplified and not completely identical with the ones proposed before. In the version we consulted, some items seem to have been written in italic font, although we couldn't find any general pattern, what this practice might hint to. In order to keep as closely to the original, however, we marked all those entries with an asterisk.	273 
Swadesh-1950-165	Swadesh, Morris	1950		165	English	Salish		Swadesh1950	The first list which was actually used by Morris Swadesh. Initially, Swadesh started from a concept list of 215 items, yet since the data did not allow to identify all of these, he then reduced the test list to 165 items for which he had enough attestations in the Salish languages.	161
Hou-2004-180	Hóu Jīngyī 侯精一	2004		180	Chinese	Chinese		Hou2004	This list is used as a basic concept list for a survey of 40 Chinese dialect varieties.	
Wiktionary-2003-207	Wiktionary	2003		207	English	Global	http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Swadesh_lists	Wiktionary, Swadesh1952, Swadesh1955	"As far as it is possible to follow the editing history of the [Wiktionary project](http://en.wiktionary.org), it seems that this concept list was first proposed in 2003. It was supposed to be a pure merger of the concepts which Swadesh proposed in [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). However, the editors did not notice (or deliberately ignored) that the former list explicitly lists the intransitive form of ""to burn"", while the latter lists ""to burn"" as transitive. Similar problems hold for ""rain"" which is explicitly labelled as a verb in the 200 item list, while no further specification is given in the 100 item list. One may of course say that these differences are minor ones, yet as a comparison with alternative approaches using the classical ""Swadesh list"" show, the incomplete descriptions of glosses have lead to a rather great degree of fuzziness in the application of concept lists for the purpose of language comparison."	
Yakhontov-1991-35	Yakhontov, Sergej	1991		35	Russian, English	Global		Starostin1991	This is the supposedly most stable part of [Jachontovs list of 100 items](:ref:Jachontov-1991-100).	93
Alpher-1999-151	Alpher, Barry and Nash, David	1999		151	English	Australian		Alpher1999	This list was originally proposed in order to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Australian languages. Its core part is based on a list of 100 items proposed by [O'Grady and Klokeid in 1969](:ref:OGrady-1969-100).	53-55
McMahon-2005-30	McMahon, April and McMahon, Robert	2005		30	English	Indo-European		McMahon2005	"This is what the authors call a ""hihi"" list for Indo-European languages in the database by [Dyen et al. (1997)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Dyen1997), that is, a list high in ""reconstructability"" and high in ""retentiveness"". So the items are supposed to be among the most stable concepts that can be found in the Indo-European languages."	109
Kassian-2010-110	Kassian, Alexej and Starostin, Georgij and Dybo, A. and Chernov, V.	2010		110	English, Russian	Global		Kassian2010	This is an attempt by the authors to further specify the meanings of concept lists for the purpose of language comparison. They take the list of [Starostin 1991](:ref:Starostin-1991-110) as a basis, which is itself a merger of the concept list proposed by [Sergej Jachontov](:ref:Jachontov-1991-100) and the 100-item list proposed by [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100).	51-89
Gabelentz-1891-121	Gabelentz, Hans Georg Conon	1891		121	German	Global		Gabelentz1891	"This list is not a real concept list in the strict sense, but rather a proposal for a useful semantic ordering of lexical entries for the purpose of language comparison. Gabelentz himself calls these ""Collectaneen zum Verwandtschaftsnachweise"" (""collections [of words] for the purpose of proving language relationship""), and instead of providing strict glosses to be translated into different languages, he provides a schema on how a given collection of lexical entries can be ordered in order to ease the work of historical linguists. Despite the fact that this is no real concept list, we thought it would be useful to include it inour collection, since it illustrates one important purpose of concept lists: to provide an initial heuristic to search for probably related words. Since Gabelentz does not provide direct glosses as examples for all parts of his schema, we added some hopefully useful examples in all those cases where an original gloss was missing. These cases, which constitute the majority of this concept list, are marked with help of an asterisk preceding the gloss."	177f
Snider-2004-1700	Snider, Keith and Roberts, James	2004		1700	English, French	African languages		Snider2004		
Zorc-1974-100	Zorc, R. David	1974		100	English	Phillipine languages		Zorc1974	This is supposed to be the typical [100 item Swadesh list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the glossing differs from the original, showing some interesting modifications resulting from the target languages used in the investigation.	432f
Gudschinsky-1956-200	Gudschinsky, Sara C.	1956		200	English	Global		Gudschinksy1956	Although the compiler of this list claims that this list reflects the original [Swadesh-list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), it contains in fact some deviations. For example, Gudschinsky introduces dashed labels (like &quot;fat-grease&quot;) in those cases where Swadesh had put one of the items in brackets (like &quot;fat (grease)&quot;). This practice has led to some confusion in later work by scholars who would claim to use Swadesh's list of 200 items but who were in fact only referring to Gudschinsky's list.	186-200
Samarin-1969-218	Samarin, William J.	1969		218	English	Global		Samarin1969	"As the compiler of this concept list notes, the reason why there are 218 concepts for what the compiler himself calls a 200-word list, is that the list is a ""conflation of [Swadesh 1955](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Swadesh1955) (where the words are listed both by semantic groups and alphabetically) and [Gudschinsky 1956](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Gudschinsky1956a)."" In the list, those items which are missing in Gudschinsky are marked with an asterisk. As the original source suggests, the list is intended to serve as a starting point for field work. The compiler of the list seems to be indifferent regarding the validity of lexicostatistics, but deems the word lists quite useful for comparison with other resources. In the study, the author also presents a [100-item list](:ref:Samarin-1969-100) which is given in a more detailed form along with additional translations into French, Spanish, and German."	220
Dixon-1919-175	Dixon, Roland B. and Kroeber, A. L.	1919		173	English	languages of California		Dixon1919	This is an early example of a concept list which was employed for the purpose of language comparison. Strictly speaking, the list itself contains much less conceptual items than 173, since the authors list items which are expressed by multiple cognate sets in the languages of California separately. In order to get these cognate sets, they used a list of 225 English words which is, unfortunately, not reported in the study. According to the authors, the list of cognate sets contains 175 items, but in the source, only 171 items are listed, with 2 further being labeled as secondary in the source. In order to keep close to the original, we decided to add their concept list in unmodified form to the concepticon.	56-61
Allen-2007-500	Allen, Brian	2007		500	English, Chinese	Bai		Allen2007	This list was taken as the reference for conducting field work on the Bai dialects, a minority language spoken in South-West China. Originally, 550 words were collected, but due to missing items in some of the languages of the survey, the list was further reduced to 500 languages.	69-113
Dolgopolsky-1964-15	Dolgopolsky, Aaron B.	1964		15	Russian, English	Global		Dolgopolsky1964, Dolgopolsky1986	"This list proposed by A. Dolgopolsky in 1964 was claimed to be ""ultrastable"", reflecting concepts which are barely replaced during language evolution. Since Dolgopolsky makes no distinction between ""who"" and ""what"", the list can be mapped to more than just the proposed 15 concepts in other concept lists (such as, for example, the [100 item list by Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100))."	55, 34f
Chen-1996-100b	Chén Bǎoyà 陈保亚	1996	b	100	Chinese	Chinese, Tai		Chen1996	This is the supposedly less stable part of the concept list, slightly modified from Swadesh's originial [concept list of 200 Items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200).	296f
Brinton-1891-21	Brinton, Daniel G.	1891		21	English	American languages	https://archive.org/details/americanraceali01bringoog	Brinton1891	This list of 21 items was used as a means to compare basic characteristics of different indigeneous languages of America.	336

Yakhontov-1991-65	Yakhontov, Sergej	1991		65	Russian, English	Global		Starostin1991	This is the supposedly less stable part of [Jachontovs list of 100 items](:ref:Jachontov-1991-100).	93
Holman-2008-40	Holman, Eric W. and Wichmann, Søren and Brown, Cecil H. and Velupillai, Viveka and Müller, Andreas and Bakker, Dik	2008		40	English	Global		Holman2008a	This list is supposed to be very stable and has been used as the reference list for the [ASJP project](http://email.eva.mpg.de/~wichmann/ASJPHomePage.htm) in which 40-word lists of more than two thirds of all languages of the world were collected.	
Bulakh-2013-870	Bulakh, Maria and Ganenkov, Dimitrij and Gruntov, Ilya and Maisak, T. and Rousseau, Maxim and Zalizniak, A.	2013		870	English	Global		Zalizniak2012,Bulakh2013	This is a small subset of the most frequent concepts in the [Database of semantic shifts in the languages of the wordl (DatSemShifts)](http://semshifts.iling-ran.ru). The list was created by extracting all concepts occuring three or more times within a sourc-target-relation in the database. The original number of concepts is rather large (we counted as many as 2424 distinct glosses). In selecting only a subset of these, we hope to reduce the number of more or less identical concepts which are assigned different glosses and IDs in the database.	
Heggarty-2005-30b	Heggarty, Paul	2005	b	30	English	Andean		McMahon2005	"This is what [McMahon and McMahon (2005)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=McMahon2005) call a ""lolo"" list for Andean languages, that is, a list low in ""reconstructability"" and low in ""retentiveness"". So the items are supposed to be among the less stable concepts that can be found in the original lexicostatistical database of Andean languages."	171

Shevoroshkin-1991-23	Shevoroshkin, Vitalij V. and Manaster Ramer, A.	1991		23	English	Global		Shevoroshkin1991	This list is an extension to [Dolgopolsky's short list of 15 items](:ref:Dolgopolsky-1964-15). According to the compilers, it was obtained by slightly relaxing Dolgopolsky's original criteria for concept selection.	188f
Blust-2008-210	Blust, Robert	2008		210	English	Austronesian	http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/word.php	Greenhill2008	This is the 210 item concept list which is used in the [Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database](http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/).	274
Swadesh-1960-100	Swadesh, Morris	1960		100	English	Global		Hymes1960	"According to the source, this list was proposed by Swadesh as a diagnostic test list that could supplement the [list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) in case researchers would face difficulties in identifying all translational equivalents for the 100 item list. Unfortunately, the only source which we could find for this list, [Hymes (1960)](http:bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Hymes1960), presents the concept glosses in an abbreviated form which does not allow us to distinguish whether we are dealing with verbal or nominal meanings. As a confusing result of this, the concept ""rain"" occurs twice, both in the [stable list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) (item 76) and in the [supplementary list](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100) (item 121)."	6
Tadmor-2009-100	Tadmor, Uri	2009		100	English	Global	http://wold.clld.org/meaning	Tadmor2009	This list is assumed to contain concepts which are not only stable but also resistant to borrowing. The concepts were selected with help of the [World Loanword Database](http://wold.clld.org) which contains various information regarding lexical borrowing in different languages of the world.	69-71
Heggarty-2005-150	Heggarty, Paul	2005		150	English, Spanish	Quechua, Aymara		McMahon2005b, McMahon2005	"This list was specifically designed to carry out lexical studies of Quechuan and Aymaran languages ([McMahon et al.

Inspired by [Matisoff's CALMSEA list](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200) containing concepts which are ""Culturally and Linguistically Meaningful for Southeast Asia"", but not necessarily for other language areas, Heggarty calls this list the CALMA list (""Culturally and Linguistically Meaningful for the Andes""). Apart from the raw list data, the data provided by the author also contains additional columns in which this new list is compared with earlier concept lists, like the two lists proposed by Swadesh ([100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), and [200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200)), and the short list proposed by [Jachontov (35 items)](:ref:Jachontov-1991-35)."

TeilDautrey-2008-430	Teil-Dautrey, Gisèle	2008		430	English	Bantu	http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/bantu/	Greenhill2008	The numbering of the concept list indicates 434 concepts in total. However, in our count and in the count on the website, only 430 items seem to have been defined. To our knowledge, there is no printed publication of the list of concepts. When mapping the concepts to the concepticon, we hade some problems in finding the correct mapping for quite a few concepts. So until we have carried out a proper re-checking of the data, asking the original authors of the concept list for help, the results of this mapping should be taken with a considerable amount of care. Since the [BBVD](http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/bantu/) was launched around the first time the [ABVD](language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/) was launched, we assign this source the same year in the reference as we assigned the [ABVD](language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/).	
Swadesh-1950-215	Swadesh, Morris	1950		215	English	Global		Swadesh1950	The first list which was proposed by Swadesh. He never applied it to the Salish language, since there was not enough data to translate the items into all Salish languages, but this was the initial list which Swadesh had envisioned. Note that in the original text, there is a spelling error, pointing to 225 items, although the actual number of items directly mentioned by Swadesh sums up to only 215.	161
Starostin-1991-110	Starostin, Sergej A.	1991		110	English, Russian	Global	http://starling.rinet.ru/	Starostin1991	This list of 110 items is the basis of the large lexicostatistical data collection of the [Tower of Babel](http://starling.rinet.ru/) project and serves also as the basic concept list of its successor, the [Global Lexicostatistical Database](http://starling.rinet.ru/new100/main.htm). The list itself is a merger of [Swadesh's 100-item list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and [Jachontov's 100-item list](:ref:Jachontov-1991-100). It is also available in [ranked order](:ref:Starostin-2007-110) with ranks reflecting the supposed stability of the items.	93

Swadesh-1955-100	Swadesh, Morris	1955		100	English	Global		Swadesh1955	Swadesh's most famous concept list of 100 items. The original article lists all 215 items originally proposed in the first article on [lexicostatistics in 1950](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Swadesh1950), but marks the most stable items specifically.	133-137
Chen-1996-200	Chén Bǎoyà 陈保亚	1996		200	Chinese	Chinese, Tai		Chen1996	This is the full concept list proposed by Chén, slightly modified from the originial [concept list of 200 items by Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200).	295-297
McMahon-2005-23	McMahon, April and McMahon, Robert	2005		23	English	Indo-European		McMahon2005	"This is what the authors call a ""lolo"" list for Indo-European languages in the database by [Dyen et al.

So the items are supposed to be among the less stable concepts that can be found in Swadesh-style databases for Indo-European languages."	109
Norman-2003-40	Norman, Jerry	2003		40	English, Chinese	Chinese		Norman2003	"This list of 40 items was proposed as a diagnostic test list to check whether a language belongs to the group of Sinitic languages or not. Note that what is labelled as ""common chinese"" in the list is a reconstruction system similar to that of Middle Chinese, but -- according to J. Norman -- less biased by the character readings of the traditional rhyme dictionaries published around 600 AD."	74f
Dunn-2012-207	Dunn, Michael	2012		207	English	Indo-European	http://ielex.mpi.nl/meanings/	Dunn2012	This list of 207 items used in the [Indo-European Lexical Cognacy Database](http://ielex.mpi.nl) is a close but not exact merger of [Swadesh's list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and his [list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). It is not exact, since transitive and intransitive forms of the verb to burn which occur separately in the initial lists, are merged into one item. This list is also used as the basic list behind the [Wiktionary Swadesh Lists](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Spanish_Swadesh_list) (see the [Wiktionary swadesh list](:ref:wiktionary-207).

In this list, 10 items from the original list were removed and 10 new items were added. The list was proposed much earlier than the source, apparently already in the beginning of the 1960ies ([Djačok 2008](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Djacok2008]), but Jachontov never published his list officially. Note that there is a spelling error in the source of [Starostin (1991: 91)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Starostin1991): In the source, the second item is labelled ""течь"" (""float"") in Russian, although the alphabetical order suggests that ""жечь"" (""burn tr."") was originally intended by the author."	93
Shiro-1973-200	Shirō, Hattori	1973		200	English	Japanese		Shiro1973	This concept list of 200 items was proposed as a diagnostic test list for lexicostatistical studies of Japanese dialects.

The compiler of the list seems to be indifferent regarding the validity of lexicostatistics, but deems the word lists quite useful for comparison with other resources. In the study, the author also presents a [200-item list](:ref:Samarin-1969-218) which in fact contains 218 items.	221-223
Gregersen-1976-217	Gregersen, Edgar A.	1976		217	English	African		Gregersen1976	This concept list is based on a merger of several concept lists proposed by Swadesh. As the compiler mentions himself, the list is composed of all 200 items proposed in [Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), all additional items proposed in [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), and [Swadeshs supplementary list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100). According to the annotation of the compiler, all items occuring in the 200-item list and the 100-item list are marked with one asterisk. All items occuring only in the 100-item list are marked with two asterisks, and all items makred with a preceding dash (—) occur only in the supplementary list.	110-116

Wilson-1969-35	Wilson, D.	1969		35	English	New Guinea		Wilson1969	This is a very small concept list created for the purpose of language comparison in New Guinea. It is not entirely clear from the source how the author ended up with this list of 35 items. According to the source, the author used some standardized list of 100 words, 57 of which also appear on the [100 item list of Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) (see [Wilson 1969: 76](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Wilson1969)).

SatterthwaitePhillips-2011-423	Satterthwaite-Phillips, Damian	2011		423	English, Chinese	Tibeto-Burman		SatterthwaitePhillips2011	This is an expanded meaning list combining parts of the lists proposed by [Matisoff 1987](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200) and the well known lists of [Swadesh (1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). The author was so friendly to provide us with an excel spreadsheet containing the data. Note that although the author mentions in his thesis on page 44 that a total of 410 words (meanings) were used to collect the data, we find as many as 423 words, including some duplicate entries, but also some entries which are obviously near synonyms but were probably split into different semantic slots by the author (who himself marks seven additional entries as not belonging to the original concept). Entries marked with an asterisk seem to reflect items which also occur on traditional concept lists and were given in the spreadsheet version of the data. Entries ending on the percentage character are those marked as later added by the author in the original source. Why some entries are marked with two greater-then characters in the spreadsheet data of the author is not entirely clear to us, but we kept it in order to provide all information that is available.	176-239
Bennet-1976-100	Bennet, P. R.	1976		100	English	Bantu		Bennet1976	This list was created to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Bantu languages. Originally, it is divided into two parts, one for nouns ([163-165](:ref:Bennet-1976-50)) and one for verbs ([166f](:ref:Bennet-1976-50b)). Here, we list both parts together.	163-167
Kraft-1981-434	Kraft, C. H.	1981		434	English, Hausa	Chadic		Kraft1981	A large conceptlist of 434 basic concepts compiled for the study of Chadic languages.	1-6
Haspelmath-2009-1460	Haspelmath, Martin and Tadmor, Uri	2009		1460	English	Global	http://wold.clld.org/meaning/	Haspelmath2009	This is the large list of concepts underlying the [World Loanword Database](http://wold.clld.org).	
OGrady-1969-100	O'Grady, Geoffrey N. and Klokeid, Terry J.	1969		100	English	Australian		OGrady1969	This is one of the earlier lists proposed for comparative studies on Australian languages. It was later used as the basis of the [151 item list by Alpher and Nash (1999)](:ref:Alpher-1999-151).	303-307
Meillet-1921-16	Meillet, Antoine	1921		16	French	Global		Meillet1965, Hymes1960	This is not a real list proposed by Meillet, but rather a collection of examples for words which are less frequently replaced during language history. The original list was published in 1921, but for our research we had to rely on a later edition from 1965.	?, 5
Bennet-1976-50a	Bennet, P. R.	1976	a	50	English	Bantu		Bennet1976	This list was created to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Bantu languages. This subset of the [complete list](:ref:Bennet-1976-100) contains only nouns.	163-165
Bennet-1976-50b	Bennet, P. R.	1976	b	50	English	Bantu		Bennet1976	This list was created to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Bantu languages. This subset of the [complete list](:ref:Bennet-1976-100) contains only verbs.	166f
Pallas-1785-441	Pallas, Peter Simon	1786		441	Russian, German, Latin, French	Global		Pallas1785	This is a very early collection of words compiled for the purpose of language comparison. From the digital version of the source, the original date of publication could not be determined. However, according to [Adelung (1815: 53)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Adelung1815), the collection was published in 1786 by order of Catherine the Great.	3-8
