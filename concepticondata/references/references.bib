ity in semantic change. Drawing on evidence from a sample of morphologically
complex terms in basic vocabulary for 149 globally distributed languages, it is ar-
gued that cross-linguistically preferred synchronic relationships of word-forma-
tion provide clues to likely directions of diachronic semantic developments. The
hypothesis is tested against diachronic data from Indo-Aryan languages, and, in
spite of a number of counterexamples, a correlation is found. In addition, it is
shown how these data can be applied to semantic reconstruction, and a scenario
of semantic change which involves morphological complexity in an early stage of
semantic development is sketched.},
