indexing this knowledge so that it can be manipulated or controlled. We offer free association data for
72,000 word pairs, along with over a million entries of related data, such as forward and backward
strength, number of competing associates, and printed frequency. A separate file contains the 5,019
normed words, their statistics, and thousands of independently normed rhyme, stem, and fragment
cues. Other files provide n  n associative networks for more than 4,000 words and a list of idiosyn-
cratic responses for each normed word. The database will be useful for investigators interested in
cuing, priming, recognition, network theory, linguistics, and implicit testing applications. They also will
be useful for evaluating the predictive value of free association probabilities as compared with other
measures, such as similarity ratings and co-occurrence norms. Of several procedures for measuring
preexisting strength between two words, the best remains to be determined. The norms may be down-
loaded from www.psychonomic.org/archive/.},
