Relevant conference topics:

- Guidelines, standards, best practices and models for LRs interoperability:

  Interoperability of lexical/wordlist data not yet addressed in a systematic way!

- LRs and Semantic Web:

  Linked Open Data => integration with the Semantic Web at large.

- Multilingual issues, language coverage and diversity, less-resourced languages:

  Language diversity often addressed with region/taxon-specific concept lists.
  This poses problems for interoperability of the lexical resources, which we
  want to overcome.

- Open, linked and shared data and tools, open and collaborative architectures:

  collaborative architecture:
  - concepticon-data curated openly and collaboratively on GitHub
  - concepticon published as Linked Open Data
  - concepticon published within the clld framework => allows reuse of clldclient!


Using concepticon:

- Dictionaria: comparison meanings across languages/dictionaries are taken from
  concepticon, and identified by matching sources glosses of concepticon concepts.
